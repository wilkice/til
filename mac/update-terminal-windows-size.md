1. open settings, choose `profile` and then set a much bigger size for window size's `Columns` and `Rows`.
2. make sure the `Dimensions` is checked.
3. watch the title, if the dimension is less than the value we input, then that is the size for make `Terminal.app` full size.
4. For my screenshot, the full screen size should be `129 * 37`
